🎮 Paddle Catcher Game
Welcome to Paddle Catcher Game, a fun and engaging Java-based arcade game where your goal is to catch the falling objects using a movable paddle. The game starts off simple, but as your score increases, the challenge rises with faster object drops and additional obstacles.

This project is fully developed using Java Swing and is a great demonstration of fundamental game development concepts such as collision detection, keyboard controls, and dynamic difficulty scaling. It's easy to run and play, making it ideal for beginners exploring Java programming and GUI-based games.

🚀 Features
🎮 Smooth Paddle Controls: Move the paddle left or right to catch falling objects.

🧩 Multiple Falling Objects: Multiple objects drop simultaneously, increasing difficulty.

⚡ Dynamic Speed: The game automatically increases the falling speed as your score rises.

❤ Lives System: You get 3 lives; missing an object costs a life. Lose all lives, and it’s game over!

🔄 Restart Option: You can restart the game anytime after it’s over by pressing the 'R' key.

🎨 Simple & Clean UI: Easy-to-understand interface with clear score and lives display.

🎯 Level Progression: Special messages appear as you achieve higher scores to keep you motivated.
